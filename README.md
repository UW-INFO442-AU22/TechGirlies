## The Issue and What We are Building
How Might We… 
How might we raise awareness in young adults about the environmental impact of the fast fashion industry while simultaneously promoting alternative, sustainable brands?
Current understanding
Fast fashion contributes to the emission of greenhouse gasses and the use of massive amounts of water and energy. In order to produce one kilogram of non-organic cotton, over 2,000 liters of water is used. Additionally, fast fashion brands often use synthetic materials that take hundreds of years to biodegrade, and that end up releasing microplastics and chemical waste into the ocean. Fast fashion is considered “fast” due to the short life cycle of each piece of clothing. Due to the poor quality and cheap nature of the clothing, it often ends up in landfills where it takes up space and encroaches into territory used by wildlife and people. Each year, approximately 85% of textiles go to landfills and over 500,000 tons of microfibers are released into the ocean.
 
Based on statements made by the United Nations Foundation, climate change is an incredibly unsustainable pattern, which fast fashion is a major contributor. Currently, the clothing industry negatively affects the environment through malpractice and sourcing raw materials unethically. If nothing is done, the industry will continue to mass produce clothing that may be less expensive for the consumer but detrimental to the environment, contributing to the growing issue of climate change. 
Furthermore, fast fashion has a high human cost, where most articles of clothing are made using exploited labor in low-income parts of the world. This reduces the cost of clothing, giving fast fashion companies a competitive advantage to the consumer over more sustainable and ethical brands. 
Cause of the problem we are targeting
Instead of trying to encourage fast fashion companies to become more sustainable, we are trying to target the consumer side of the problem by encouraging consumers to shop more responsibly and sustainably and enlighten consumers on the environmental effects of the fast fashion industry.
Additionally, many consumers do not know how to identify poor quality clothing, and indulge in fast fashion brands because of the cheap prices. By implementing an educational platform to showcase the long-term pay-off of investing in high-quality, long-lasting clothing, we can encourage our applications’ users to be more responsible in their clothing consumption, reduce waste, reduce their environmental footprint, and ensure that the clothing they are purchasing was not made through the exploitation of others.

## What We Are Building
### Prioritized Features:
#### P0:
- Responsive navigation bar
- “Are your clothes sustainable” check-list/information page to allow consumers to change their behavior when looking at clothes
- Research-based information (background) regarding the effects of the fast fashion industry on the environment
- Why specifically ____ brands/types of clothing are unsustainable
- Carousel or display of general brands/websites that feature and support sustainable fashion
#### P1:
- Carousel sort feature - allow users to prioritize cost efficiency, maximum sustainability, ease of purchase, etc.
- “If you like ___ type of style/clothing you might like ____ brand” sustainable brand suggestions from corresponding to the type of clothing the user would like to purchase
#### P2:
- Possible additional feature: capsule closet suggestions (staples) - timeless pieces of clothing > trendy fast fashion
- Ability to bookmark brands/styles a user likes
- API or external database for clothing brand/options

Of all the features you plan to include in your MVP, which one seems like the most challenging to develop, and why?
We believe that P2, the capsule closet suggestion feature, will be the most challenging to develop. In order to link an external database and allow users to bookmark items, we likely would need to utilize back-end development with Firebase. We also would need to find a comprehensive database of clothing brand options, process and clean this data, and ensure that potential users of our web app across many fashion senses have an adequate number of options.
