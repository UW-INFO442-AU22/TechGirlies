## The Issue

Based on statements made by the United Nations Foundation, the unsustainable pattern of fast fashion is a major contributor to climate change. While less expensive for the consumer, fast fashion clothing often ends up in landfills due to its poor quality and cheap materials. Each year, approximately 85% of textiles go to landfills and over 500,000 tons of microfibers are released into the ocean.

Furthermore, fast fashion has a high human cost, where most articles of clothing are made using exploited labor in low-income parts of the world. This raises several humanitarian concerns surrounding child labor, poor working conditions, and underpaid employees. 

However, despite the many problematic aspects of the industry, fast fashion brands continue to profit off of consumers drawn in by cheap prices, unaware of the true cost. 

## About Conscious

As part of an INFO 442 class project, Conscious was designed to combat the fast fashion by serving as an educational platform for sustainable style choices. By showcasing the long-term payoff of investing in high-quality, long-lasting clothing, Conscious encourages its users to be more responsible in their clothing consumption, reduce their environmental footprint, and ensure that their purchases do not contibute to the exploitation of others.

Of all the features you plan to include in your MVP, which one seems like the most challenging to develop, and why?
We believe that P2, the capsule closet suggestion feature, will be the most challenging to develop. In order to link an external database and allow users to bookmark items, we likely would need to utilize back-end development with Firebase. We also would need to find a comprehensive database of clothing brand options, process and clean this data, and ensure that potential users of our web app across many fashion senses have an adequate number of options.
