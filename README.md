## The Issue

Based on statements made by the United Nations Foundation, the unsustainable pattern of fast fashion is a major contributor to climate change. While less expensive for the consumer, fast fashion clothing often ends up in landfills due to its poor quality and cheap materials, while also commonly exploiting labor in low-income parts of the world. 

However, despite the many problematic aspects of the industry, fast fashion brands continue to profit off of consumers drawn in by cheap prices, unaware of the true cost. 

## About Conscious

As part of an INFO 442 class project, Conscious was designed to combat fast fashion by serving as an educational platform for sustainable style choices. By showcasing the long-term payoff of investing in high-quality, long-lasting clothing, Conscious encourages its users to be more responsible in their clothing consumption, reduce their environmental footprint, and ensure that their purchases do not contibute to the exploitation of others.
