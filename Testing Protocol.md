# Testing Protocol for Conscious

## Protocols:

1. Download Google Chrome browser 
2. Open live link of Conscious through local host
3. Features to test:   
    *  Navigate between all of the pages (Home, Find Brands, Find Styles, Materials, Checklist)
    *  Ensure all images and text appear properly
    *  On Home: watch embedded YouTube video
    *  On Find Brands: search for a specific brand and click on the images to be redirected 
    *  On Find Styles: click on style boards and click on images to be redirected

## Bugs:

1. Pages did not load when navigated to
2. Images were not displaying

We discovered these bugs by constantly checking the local host link during development to ensure the displays aligned with the code. The bugs were resolved using Developer Tools to locate console output and error messages.
